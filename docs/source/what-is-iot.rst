What is IOT?
############

The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability,
software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or
other communications networks. Internet of things has been considered a misnomer because devices do
not need to be connected to the public internet, they only need to be connected to a network and be individually
addressable. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things>
